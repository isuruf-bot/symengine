# API Documentation Guide

We write all the API documentation with [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl). Note the following conventions:

- Use the JavaDoc style (mostly)
    - This means `@` instead of `\`
    - Also `/**` for comment blocks
    - Use `//!` for inline details and  `///` for brief inline descriptions
- We **do** expect private variables to be documented
